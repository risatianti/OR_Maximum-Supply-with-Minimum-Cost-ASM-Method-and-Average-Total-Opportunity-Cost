# Solving Transportation Problem using Maximum Supply with Minimum Cost (MSMC), ASM Method, and Average Total Oppurtunity Cost (ATOC)
Comparison of methods on solving Transportation Problem (TP). This project is in a collaboration with my colleague in Operation Research consentration, Ahmad Dimyati, that will be used in his thesis research: "Perbandingan Metode Maximum Supply with Minimum Cost (MSMC), ASM Method, dan Average Total Opportunity Cost (ATOC) dalam Penyelesaian Masalah Transportasi".
